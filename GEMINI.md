# Project: Virus Game

## Project Overview

This project is a web-based implementation of the turn-based strategy game "Virus" (also known as "Война вирусов"). It is built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The game is played on a 10x10 grid. Two players, represented by 'X' and 'O', take turns to expand their territory. Each player has three moves per turn, which can be used to place new pieces, kill opponent's pieces, or place neutral pieces.

## Building and Running

This is a simple web project with no build process. To run the game, you can either:

1.  Open the `index.html` file directly in a web browser.
2.  Run a simple web server in the project directory. For example:

    ```bash
    npx http-server
    ```

## Development Conventions

There are no formal development conventions enforced in this project. The code is structured as follows:

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the game page.
*   `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the game board and pieces.
*   `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains all the game logic.
