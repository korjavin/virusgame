# Virus Game Rules

This document outlines the rules for the Virus Game.

## Objective

The objective of the game is to eliminate all of your opponent's pieces from the board.

## Gameplay

The game is played on a grid of a customizable size. Two players, X (Player 1) and O (Player 2), take turns to expand their territory.

Each player starts with a single **base cell** in their respective corner of the board.

Each player has **three moves** per turn.

A move consists of one of the following actions:

1.  **Grow:** Place a new piece in an empty cell adjacent to one of your existing pieces. The piece you are expanding from **must be part of a chain connected to your initial base cell**.

2.  **Attack:** Attack an opponent's piece in a cell adjacent to one of your existing pieces. The piece you are attacking from **must be part of a chain connected to your initial base cell**. When you attack an opponent's cell, it is converted into a **fortified cell** of your color. 

## Fortified Cells

-   When you successfully attack an opponent's cell, it becomes a fortified cell.
-   Fortified cells are permanently owned by the attacking player and **cannot be re-taken** for the rest of the game.
-   Fortified cells are visually distinct, appearing with a solid background color.
-   You can use your fortified cells to grow and attack from, just like your normal pieces.

## Putting Neutrals

Once per game, each player has the ability to place two neutral fields on their own, non-fortified cells. This action replaces your entire turn (all three moves).

To use this ability, click the "Put Neutrals" button and then select two of your own cells to neutralize. This can be a strategic move to block an opponent's advance.

## Winning the Game

A player wins when their opponent has no pieces left on the board.
