# Virus Game Rules

This document outlines the rules for the Virus Game.

## Objective

The objective of the game is to eliminate all of your opponent's pieces from the board.

## Gameplay

The game is played on a grid of a customizable size. Two players, X (Player 1) and O (Player 2), take turns to expand their territory.

Each player has **three moves** per turn.

A move consists of one of the following actions:

1.  **Grow:** Place a new piece in an empty cell adjacent to one of your existing pieces. This expands your territory.

2.  **Attack:** Attack an opponent's piece in a cell adjacent to one of your existing pieces. When you attack an opponent's cell, it is converted into a **fortified cell** of your color. 

## Fortified Cells

-   When you successfully attack an opponent's cell, it becomes a fortified cell.
-   Fortified cells are permanently owned by the attacking player and **cannot be re-taken** for the rest of the game.
-   Fortified cells are visually distinct, appearing with a solid background color.
-   You can use your fortified cells to grow and attack from, just like your normal pieces.

## Winning the Game

A player wins when their opponent has no pieces left on the board.

## Passing a Turn

If a player cannot make a move, or chooses not to, they can pass their turn by clicking the "Pass Turn" button.
